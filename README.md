## Kubernetes setup
Kubernetes is a container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management. It works with a variety of container runtimes such as Docker, Containerd, and CRI-O.
## Main functions
- Deploys to any environment that supports Kubernetes, locally or remotely, including environments like OpenShift.
- Supports running code written in any language, with some common runtimes prepackaged with the framework.
- Triggers the execution of code by many kinds of events—an HTTP endpoint, a queue message, or some other hook.

## Install Docker Engine
To install Docker Engine, you need the 64-bit version of one of these Ubuntu versions:
- Ubuntu Impish 21.10
- Ubuntu Hirsute 21.04
- Ubuntu Focal 20.04 (LTS)
- Ubuntu Bionic 18.04 (LTS)

Docker Engine is supported on x86_64 (or amd64), armhf, arm64, and s390x architectures.

### Uninstall old versions

Older versions of Docker were called **docker**, **docker.io**, or **docker-engine**. If these are installed, uninstall them by entering the following commands in sequence:
```sh
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
```
It’s OK if **apt-get** reports that none of these packages are installed.

The contents of `/var/lib/docker/`, including images, containers, volumes, and networks, are preserved. If you do not need to save your existing data, and want to start with a clean installation, enter the following commands in sequence:
To uninstall the Docker Engine, CLI, and Containerd packages:
```sh
 sudo apt-get purge docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
 ```
To delete all images, containers, and volumes:
```sh
 sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker
 sudo rm -rf /var/lib/containerd
 ```
## Installation methods

You can install Docker Engine in different ways, depending on your needs:
- Set up Docker’s repositories and install from them, for ease of installation and upgrade tasks.
- Download the DEB package and install it manually and manage upgrades completely manually. This is useful in situations such as installing Docker on air-gapped systems with no access to the internet.
- Use automated convenience scripts to install Docker.

### Install using the repository
Before you install Docker Engine for the first time on a new host machine, you need to set up the Docker repository. Afterward, you can install and update Docker from the repository.
#### Set up the repository
1. Update the **apt** package index and install packages to allow **apt** to use a repository over HTTPS:
```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
 ```
 
2. Add Docker’s official GPG key:
```sh
 curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
 ```

3. Use the following command to set up the stable repository. To add the nightly or test repository, add the word **nightly** or **test** (or both) after the word **stable** in the commands below.
```sh
 echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```
#### Install Docker Engine
1. Update the **apt** package index, and install the latest version of Docker Engine and containerd, or go to the next step to install a specific version:
```sh
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```
> Note: Got multiple Docker repositories?
If you have multiple Docker repositories enabled, installing or updating without specifying a version in the apt-get install or apt-get update command always installs the highest possible version, which may not be appropriate for your stability needs.

2. To install a specific version of Docker Engine, list the available versions in the repo, then select and install:

a. List the versions available in your repo:
```sh
apt-cache madison docker-ce
```
b. Install a specific version using the version string from the second column, for example, **5:18.09.1~3-0~ubuntu-xenial**.
```sh
 sudo apt-get install docker-ce=<VERSION_STRING> docker-ce-cli=<VERSION_STRING> containerd.io
```
3. Verify that Docker Engine is installed correctly by running the hello-world image.
```sh
     sudo docker run hello-world
```
This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints a message and exits.

Docker Engine is installed and running. The **docker** group is created but no users are added to it. You need to use **sudo** to run Docker commands. 
#### Upgrade Docker Engine
To upgrade Docker Engine, first run **sudo apt-get update**, then follow the _Set up the repository part above_, choosing the new version you want to install.

### Install from a package
If you cannot use Docker’s repository to install Docker Engine, you can download the **.deb** file for your release and install it manually. You need to download a new file each time you want to upgrade Docker.

1. Go to `https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/dists/`, choose your Ubuntu version, then browse to `pool/stable/`, choose **amd64**, **armhf**, **arm64**, or **s390x**, and download the **.deb** file for the Docker Engine version you want to install.
> Note:Note
To install a nightly or test (pre-release) package, change the word stable in the above URL to nightly or test. Learn about nightly and test channels.

2. Install Docker Engine, changing the path below to the path where you downloaded the Docker package.
```sh
sudo dpkg -i /path/to/package.deb
```
The Docker daemon starts automatically.

3. Verify that Docker Engine is installed correctly by running the hello-world image.
```sh
sudo docker run hello-world
```
This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints a message and exits.

Docker Engine is installed and running. The **docker** group is created but no users are added to it. You need to use **sudo** to run Docker commands. 
#### Upgrade Docker Engine

To upgrade Docker Engine, download the newer package file and repeat the _Set up the repository part above_, pointing to the new file.

### Install using the convenience script

Docker provides a convenience script at get.docker.com to install Docker into development environments quickly and non-interactively. The convenience script is not recommended for production environments, but can be used as an example to create a provisioning script that is tailored to your needs. Also refer to the _Set up the repository part above_ steps to learn about installation steps to install using the package repository. The source code for the script is open source, and can be found in the **docker-install** (repository on GitHub)[https://github.com/docker/docker-install].

Always examine scripts downloaded from the internet before running them locally. Before installing, make yourself familiar with potential risks and limitations of the convenience script:

- The script requires root or sudo privileges to run.
- The script attempts to detect your Linux distribution and version and configure your package management system for you, and does not allow you to customize most installation parameters.
- The script installs dependencies and recommendations without asking for confirmation. This may install a large number of packages, depending on the current configuration of your host machine.
- By default, the script installs the latest stable release of Docker, containerd, and runc. When using this script to provision a machine, this may result in unexpected major version upgrades of Docker. Always test (major) upgrades in a test environment before deploying to your production systems.
- The script is not designed to upgrade an existing Docker installation. When using the script to update an existing installation, dependencies may not be updated to the expected version, causing outdated versions to be used.

> Note:preview script steps before running
    You can run the script with the **DRY_RUN=1** option to learn what steps the script will execute during installation:
```sh
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
DRY_RUN=1 sh ./get-docker.sh
```

This example downloads the script from get.docker.com and runs it to install the latest stable release of Docker on Linux:
```sh
 curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
 sudo sh get-docker.sh
```
Docker is installed. The **docker** service starts automatically on Debian based distributions. On **RPM** based distributions, such as CentOS, Fedora, RHEL or SLES, you need to start it manually using the appropriate **systemctl** or **service** command. As the message indicates, non-root users cannot run Docker commands by default.

> Note:Use Docker as a non-privileged user, or install in rootless mode?
The installation script requires root or sudo privileges to install and use Docker. If you want to grant non-root users access to Docker, refer to the post-installation steps for Linux. Docker can also be installed without root privileges, or configured to run in rootless mode. For instructions on running Docker in rootless mode, refer to run the Docker daemon as a non-root user (rootless mode).

#### Install pre-releases

Docker also provides a convenience script at test.docker.com to install pre-releases of Docker on Linux. This script is equivalent to the script at get.docker.com, but configures your package manager to enable the “test” channel from our package repository, which includes both stable and pre-releases (beta versions, release-candidates) of Docker. Use this script to get early access to new releases, and to evaluate them in a testing environment before they are released as stable.

To install the latest version of Docker on Linux from the “test” channel, run:
```sh
 curl -fsSL https://test.docker.com -o test-docker.sh
 sudo sh test-docker.sh
```
####Upgrade Docker after using the convenience script
If you installed Docker using the convenience script, you should upgrade Docker using your package manager directly. There is no advantage to re-running the convenience script, and it can cause issues if it attempts to re-add repositories which have already been added to the host machine.
